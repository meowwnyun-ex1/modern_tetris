## How to Implement Changes

1. **Replace the files** with the updated versions
2. **Create assets directory** structure if it doesn't exist:

   ```
   /assets
     /images
       /backgrounds
         denso_bg.png  (optional: create a background with DENSO styling)
       icon.png  (create a DENSO Tetris icon)
     /sounds
       (add sound files as per SOUND_FILES in constants.py)
     /fonts
       arial.ttf (or your preferred font)
   ```

3. **Test the game** to ensure all components work correctly with the new theme

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Create a custom DENSO background image**:

   - Design a background with the DENSO red color scheme
   - Add subtle DENSO branding elements or patterns

2. **Add DENSO sound effects**:

   - Replace generic sound effects with more professional ones
   - Consider adding a DENSO-themed soundtrack

3. **Fine-tune the appearance**:
   - Adjust the visual elements to match DENSO's design guidelines
   - Consider incorporating additional DENSO branding elements

This implementation preserves all the original game functionality while giving it a professional, DENSO-branded appearance with proper language support.
